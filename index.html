            <p>Hello, my name is Hyrum Wines, and I'm from Pheonix, Arizona. I am the first of two kids in my family. I
                enjoy playing tabletop role playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons. I also enjoying playing other
                games such as Warhammer 40,000, Zombie Dice, Monster Hunter, Magic The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, The Legened
                of Zelda, and Warframe. I also enjoy reading, rollerblading listening to music, watching older comedy TV
                shows such as M*A*S*H and Hogan's Heros. I recently returned from a 2 year mission in Washington DC and
                Southern Maryland. I am currently serving as the Elder's Qourum(Men's group) President in my Young
                Single Adult Ward(congregation) in my church. I have been able to earn different awards in Future
                Buisness Leaders of America a High School program to help high schoolers to be prepared for entering the
                work force and ultimately buisness in general. The awards I have been able to earn from FBLA are in
                Website Design and Development, I have also earned a reward in Software Development in the State level
                of competitions that Future Buisness Leaders of America provide. I am currently working towards a
                Bachelor's Degree in Software Development, through Bringham Young University Pathway and Bringham Young
                University Idaho Online. I have been fortunate enough to be able to afford my classes so far with out
                going into any debt, through the funds I've earned from delievering food for DoorDash.</p>
